Hello everyone,

I'm Mayura. I have written a program to encode and decode data.
This is the Python program for Caesar's encypher that can accept any input and shift value from user and perform the encypher operation. 
Decypher operation if some encoded message is given as input.
Sending confidential messages with clean encoding and decoding.
It has great importance especially in cyber intelligence as well as defence ministry. There are many kinds of encyphering techniques prevailing now. 
This is an ancient and simple encypher method. 
Look at this encoded message  : L ORYH BRX 
When decoded, it looks this way : I LOVE YOU 
This is for shift value of 3
Finally we will have,

Shift value: 3 
Actual     : A B C D E F G ...... U V W X Y Z 
Encoded : C D E F G H I ........ X Y Z A B C
